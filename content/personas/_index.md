<p>
Before you start, loosen your grip on whatever tools taught you that synthesis must pass through oscillator banks,
that envelopes “shape” signals, that visuals must live in their own rendering loops,
that audio and graphics belong to different worlds, and that rhythm only comes from sequencers and clocks.
Those habits make sense in systems built to imitate hardware. 
They don’t help in a space where everything is data and nothing has to behave like a circuit.
</p>

<p>
MayaFlux begins with your instincts, not your categories.

The labels: Musician, visual artist, game developer, etc…
those labels describe where you came from, not what you can do here.
The personas simply give you a place to stand while your old mental models dissolve and new ones form inside computation.

</p>

<p>
Think of this as the real beginning: not learning MayaFlux, but learning what digital space actually is
when you stop borrowing metaphors.
</p>

# Finding Your Entry Point

<div class="card">
<h2>You Are the Artist</h2>
<p>
Not "user." Not "developer." Not "musician" or "visual artist" or "creative technologist."
</p>
<p>
You are the artist. You have ideas. You have intuitions about what should exist. You have frustrations with what currently exists. You dream about possibilities.
</p>
<p>
MayaFlux exists to let you build those dreams without compromise.
</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>This Isn't About Learning MayaFlux</h2>
<p>
We're not teaching you a tool. We're inviting you to imagine freely in computational space, and showing you that MayaFlux can handle whatever you imagine.
</p>
<p>
The persona documents that follow aren't tutorials. They're invitations to think differently.
Each one starts from a familiar place (musician, visual artist, game developer) not because those categories matter,
but because you need somewhere to stand before you leap.
</p>
<p><strong>Don't read them to "learn the API."</strong> Read them to see what kinds of thinking become possible when you stop accepting the limitations of existing tools.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>The Tool Serves You</h2>
<p>
MayaFlux doesn't convert your ideas into "its" paradigm. It provides computational substrate that bends to your vision.
</p>
<p>
You want audio and visuals on the same timeline? No conversion needed. They're already the same data.
You want rhythm from chaos? Logic from amplitude? Time that speeds up and slows down based on musical conditions?
These aren't "features." They're just what numbers can do when nothing stops them.
</p>
<p>
The boundaries you've learned ("this is audio software," "this is graphics software," "I'm a musician not a programmer")
are artifacts of commercial tool design, not computational reality. MayaFlux removes them.
</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>Imagination First, API When Needed</h2>
<p>
You don't need to understand coroutines or lock-free atomics or C++ templates to use MayaFlux.
You need to imagine what you want to exist.
</p>
<p>
When you have that vision clear, then you look for the mechanism.
The examples scattered through these documents already cover enough API surface to invoke your imagination.
When you need more, the documentation exists. When the documentation isn't enough, you ask.
</p>
<p><strong>Start with the dream.</strong> The implementation comes after.</p>
<p>
Most people do it backwards: learn the tool, then try to have ideas within its constraints.
That's how tools control artists instead of serving them. We're suggesting you reverse that relationship.
</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>Transcend</h2>
<p>
In digital space, you are more than where you came from.
</p>

<p>
The tools you currently use have trained you in certain patterns:
"oscillators are separate from envelopes," "audio and video are different pipelines,"
"control is separate from data," "I make sound, someone else makes visuals."
</p>

<p>
None of these boundaries are necessary. They exist because physical hardware had those limitations,
and software inherited them out of familiarity or laziness or market segmentation.
</p>

<p><strong>In computational space, data is data.</strong>
Audio samples are numbers. Pixel colors are numbers. Logic states are numbers. Time is numbers.
Once you accept that, all the disciplinary separations dissolve.
</p>

<p>
A musician can drive particle system. A visual artist can generate rhythm.
A game developer can treat sound as sculptural material.
Not because they "learned programming," but because they imagined something that required it,
and the substrate let them build it.
</p>

<p>You will outgrow whatever category brought you here. That's the point.</p>

# Choose Your Starting Point

<div class="card-grid breakout">

<div class="card vertical">
<h3><a href="musician_starting/">I'm a Musician</a></h3>
<p>
Starts with oscillators and envelopes you already know, then shows what happens when
you stop thinking about signal flow and start thinking about data transformation.
</p>
<p><em>You'll end up controlling visuals, writing your own synthesis algorithms, and
wondering why you ever accepted the limitations of Max or SuperCollider.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="card vertical">
<h3><a href="visual_artist_starting">I'm a Visual Artist</a></h3>
<p>
Starts with pixels and frames, then shows what happens when graphics processing runs
on the same substrate as audio DSP.
</p>
<p><em>You'll end up generating audio from visual algorithms, live-coding entire scenes,
and wondering why openFrameworks ever separated graphics from sound.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="card vertical">
<h3><a href="game_dev_starting">I'm a Game Developer</a></h3>
<p>
Starts with game loops and audio middleware, then shows what procedural soundscapes
look like when synthesis runs native in your engine.
</p>
<p><em>You'll end up treating sound as gameplay material, building instruments that respond
to player input at sample rate, and wondering why game audio was ever relegated
to "sound design."</em></p>
</div>

<div class="card vertical">
<h3><a href="researcher_starting">I'm a Researcher</a></h3>
<p>
Starts with existing DSP theory and conventions, then shows what changes when
you have direct computational access without abstraction layers.
</p>
<p><em>You'll end up validating theories existing tools couldn't implement, publishing new paradigms,
and wondering why creative tools were ever built on compromised architectures.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="card vertical">
<h3><a href="universal_starting">I Don't Fit These Categories</a></h3>
<p>
Starts from scratch. No assumptions. Just computational substrate and examples of what it can do.
</p>
<p><em>You'll end up wherever your imagination takes you, which is exactly the point.</em></p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="card wide">
<h2>What Happens Next</h2>
<p>
You'll read one of these documents. Something will click. You'll think
"oh, I could build <em>that thing I've always wanted</em>."
</p>

<p>
Then you'll open the examples. Run some code. Modify it. Break it. Fix it. Start building.
When you need more, you'll know where to look.
</p>

<p><strong>The tool serves the vision.</strong> Not the other way around.</p>

<p>
Welcome. Start wherever you want. Leave whenever you want.
Come back when you have something you need to build.
</p>

<p>The substrate will be here.</p>
