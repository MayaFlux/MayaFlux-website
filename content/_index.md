<!-- CARD 1: Digital Paradigm -->
<div class="card">

<h2>Beyond Analog Metaphors</h2>

<p>
Most creative coding tools simulate analog hardware—virtual knobs, cables, circuit boards.  
This imposes constraints that don't exist in computation.

<strong>MayaFlux embraces true digital paradigms.</strong>

<!-- CARD 2: What Makes MayaFlux Different -->
<div class="card">

<h2>What Makes MayaFlux Different</h2>

<div class="feature-grid">

<div class="feature-card">
<h3>Unified Data Streams</h3>
<p>Audio, visual, and control signals are all numerical streams that can interact freely.</p>
</div>

<div class="feature-card">
<h3>Digital-First Thinking</h3>
<p>Recursive algorithms, grammar-defined operations, and non-analog logic are first-class citizens.</p>
</div>

<div class="feature-card">
<h3>Live Coding with Lila</h3>
<p>Modify C++ code at runtime via LLVM21 JIT—change algorithms without stopping audio.</p>
</div>

<div class="feature-card">
<h3>Coroutine Temporal Control</h3>
<p>C++20 coroutines treat time as compositional material, enabling sample-accurate scheduling.</p>
</div>

<div class="feature-card">
<h3>Lock-Free Architecture</h3>
<p>Atomic operations (C++20 atomic_ref) ensure real-time safety without locks or contention.</p>
</div>

<div class="feature-card">
<h3>GPU Compute Integration</h3>
<p>Vulkan compute shaders integrate directly into audio streams using descriptor sets + semaphores.</p>
</div>

</div>

</div>

<!-- CARD 3: Philosophy -->
<div class="card">

<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<div class="philosophy-points">

<div class="philosophy-point">
<h3>Data is Data</h3>
<p>MayaFlux removes disciplinary boundaries—sound, visuals, control signals are all data.</p>
</div>

<div class="philosophy-point">
<h3>Code as Creative Material</h3>
<p>Data transformation is the creative act; programming is compositional structure.</p>
</div>

<div class="philosophy-point">
<h3>Time as Structure</h3>
<p>Temporal relationships are part of artistic expression, not implementation detail.</p>
</div>

<div class="philosophy-point">
<h3>Hooks Everywhere</h3>
<p>No protective abstractions; full access to computational machinery when you need it.</p>
</div>

</div>

</div>

<!-- CARD 4: Built From Necessity -->
<div class="card">

<h2>Built From Necessity</h2>

<p>
MayaFlux wasn’t built to improve on existing tools—it was built because they could not support the work already happening.
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>15+ years of interdisciplinary performance</strong> across Chennai, Delhi, and the Netherlands</li>
<li><strong>Production audio engineering</strong> for Unreal Engine 5 and Metro: Awakening VR</li>
<li><strong>Experimental creative computing education</strong>—seeing students hit the ceilings of PD, Max/MSP, openFrameworks</li>
<li>Experience pushing the limits of instruments, Eurorack, and DSP systems</li>
</ul>

<p>
When tools protect you from complexity, they also protect you from possibility.  
MayaFlux was built to remove those ceilings.
</p>

<!-- CARD 5: Current Status -->
<div class="card">

<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> Core audio subsystem stable. Vulkan rendering in active development. Lila JIT working.</p>

<p><strong>Production-ready:</strong> Audio processing, node graphs, memory management, lock-free scheduling, basic Vulkan textures + particles.</p>

<p><strong>In development:</strong> GPU compute routing, cross-modal connectors, full documentation.</p>

<p><strong>Future:</strong> Lua scripting (Sol2), UE5/Godot plugins, WASM, distributed compute pipelines.</p>

</div>

<!-- CARD 6: Call to Action -->
<div class="card">

<h2>Ready to Explore?</h2>

<p>
MayaFlux is for creators who've outgrown callback-driven thinking and want unified streams across audio, visual, and algorithmic composition.
